# repl

I just really wanted to make a repl.

### Language

I landed on a mini Scheme, because I wanted it to be for a LISP language

Next up: variables 😍

Maybe I'll even make a frontend at some point!

### Hmm, let me try this

Go to your terminal and run

```
stack install
```

and then I think

```
stack build
```

and if that goes well you can do

```
stack run
```

and you should be good. Or else your guess is as good as mine 😄

I'm just assuming you have stack and parsec and all that installed 😇😘
