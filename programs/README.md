# Programs

repl doesn't let you pass programs as input. I tried to do "stack run -- ./programs/list-length.scm" but it didn't work either. Anyway, this folder contains some programs you should be able to run.

You can run the ones in `statements.txt` first, and then the ones in `expressions.tsx`. You can also try the Scheme programs in `actual-scheme.scm`.
